# Advent of Code 2021

This are my (attempts at) solutions to **[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) [2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021/)**.
I'll try to code them in python (3).

If possible I will try to visualize something (solution, problem input, ...)
for every puzzle.
I will use the *pycairo* package to generate `.svg` files.

## Day 1

[Easy problem](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/1) to start: view the [sonar scan](images/day1.svg) of my input with the
three-measure average superimposed in green.

## Day 2
[The submarine](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/2) moves!

View the path of the submarine with the [first part](images/day2_1.svg) commands interpretation,
or the [second part](images/day2_2.svg) commands intrepretation.

## Day 3

[Power consumtpion and life support](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/3) rating of the submarine are OK!

I don't know what I can visualize this time... so no visualizations today.

## Day 4

A [giant squid](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/4) attached itself to my (or Santa's?) submrine.

Like day 3, I don't know what to show... so no visualizations also today.

## Day 5

Be ware of the [hydrothermal vents](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/5)!

View the [lines of vents](images/day5.svg) of my input.

In the code you can activate the visualization of the lines of vents with lines, circles or both.
