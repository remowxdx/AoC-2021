# Advent of Code 2021

This are my (attempts at) solutions to **[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) [2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021/)**.
I'll try to code them in python (3).

If possible I will try to visualize something (solution, problem input, ...)
for every puzzle.
I will use the *pycairo* package to generate `.svg` files.


## Day 1

[Easy problem](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/1) to start: view the [sonar scan](images/day1.svg) of my input with the
three-measure average superimposed in green.


## Day 2
[The submarine](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/2) moves!

View the path of the submarine with the [first part](images/day2_1.svg) commands interpretation,
or the [second part](images/day2_2.svg) commands intrepretation.


## Day 3

[Power consumtpion and life support](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/3) rating of the submarine are OK!

I don't know what I can visualize this time... so no visualizations today.


## Day 4

A [giant squid](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/4) attached itself to my (or Santa's?) submarine.

Like day 3, I don't know what to show... so no visualizations also today.


## Day 5

Be ware of the [hydrothermal vents](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/5)!

View the [lines of vents](images/day5.svg) of my input.

In the code you can activate the visualization of the lines of vents with lines, circles or both.


## Day 6

The [lanternfish invasion](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/6)!

Take a look to the graph of lanternfish population [after 80 days](images/day6_80.svg) and
[after 256 days](images/day6_256.svg).

This is really an exponential growth.


## Day 7

Run away from the [whale](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/7)! With the help of crabs.

I graphed the total cost of the fuel for every target position (in red) and the number of
crab in every position (black) for [part 1](images/day7_1.svg) and [part 2](images/day7_2.svg).
In green you should see the position with the minimal cost.


## Day 8

Who wired the [seven-segment displays](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/8)?

Look at the displays [how they are and how they should be](images/day8_2.svg)!


## Day 9

Down in the [lava tubes](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/9)!

Look at the [caves map](images/day9_1.svg), where red is low, green is high.
The dots are local lowest points with yellow high risk level and blue low
risk level.

It's now late and don't have time for the second part visualization.
Maybe tomorrow.


## Day 10

The same who wired the seven-segment displays, also programmed
the [navigation subsystem](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/10)!

Today no visualization.


## Day 11

Encounter with the [flashing octopuses](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/11)!

Today no visualization either.


## Day 12

Finding the [paths to the exit](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/12)!

Look at [map of the caves](images/day12.svg).


## Day 13

Finding the [infrared camera code](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/13)!

Today I simply drew every step of the [transparent dotted paper](images/day13.svg).


## Day 14

Synthetizing the [optimal polymer](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/14)!

Look at graph of the quantity of the [elements in the polymer](images/day14.svg) during the growth.
We have Nitrogen, Oxygen, Vanadium, Fluorine, Boron, Potassium (K), Sulfur, Hydrogen and Phosphorus.


## Day 15

Will I ever [exit the cave](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/15)?

And here is [the lowest risk path to the exit](images/day15.png) and the lowest total risk to reach
each position from blue (low risk) to red (highest risk).
